This project is to build an AI-based Music Mood Classifier. An AI-based Music Mood Classifier is a system that uses artificial intelligence to analyze music tracks and categorize them based on the emotions or mood they convey. By leveraging machine learning techniques, the classifier can detect and label various moods in music, such as "happy," "sad," "energetic," "relaxed," or even more nuanced emotions depending on the dataset and model used.

Key Components of a Music Mood Classifier:
Audio Feature Extraction: The classifier starts by analyzing audio features from the music tracks. This involves extracting characteristics such as tempo, rhythm, pitch, timbre, loudness, and key, which can all contribute to the emotional perception of music. Libraries like LibROSA in Python are often used for this purpose.

Dataset of Labeled Music Moods: The model needs a dataset of music tracks labeled with mood categories to train effectively. Datasets like the Million Song Dataset or smaller mood-labeled collections are commonly used to provide a foundation for learning mood patterns in music.

Machine Learning or Deep Learning Model: A classifier can be built using various AI techniques:

Traditional ML Models: Techniques like Support Vector Machines (SVM), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and Random Forest can be applied to mood classification based on extracted audio features.
Deep Learning Models: More advanced systems use Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to process spectrograms (visual representations of sound), or Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) for sequential audio data. CNNs in particular are useful for mood classification because they can capture complex patterns in the audio's frequency spectrum.
Training and Fine-Tuning: The model is trained on the labeled dataset to recognize patterns associated with different moods. During training, the classifier learns to associate specific audio features and spectrogram patterns with mood labels, and the model is adjusted until it can predict moods with reasonable accuracy on new, unseen music tracks.

Evaluation and Adjustment: Once trained, the model is evaluated using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. The performance is often refined through hyperparameter tuning and by adding more varied data.

Application and Use Cases: Once trained, the Music Mood Classifier can be applied to tasks such as:

Creating mood-based music playlists.
Enhancing music recommendation algorithms.
Supporting therapeutic applications by selecting mood-specific music.
Enabling DJs or radio stations to sort music based on the atmosphere they wish to create.
